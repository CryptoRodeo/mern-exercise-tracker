JS library for building user interfaces

lets you build interfaces from components


components:

components tell react what to render on the page.

react updates and re-renders components when data changes.


render():

- Takes a description of what to display on the screen and returns the result.


jsx: 

any js expression can be put in between curly braces.

className -> used in place of class.


react-router-dom:

Makes it easer to route different url's paths to different react components that will load on the page.

Route component:

path element: the url path

component= : loads the component at that url


state: 

basically variables in react

When state is updated, the component and page will be updated with the new values.

state properties are updated using methods

you use the setState property in order to update the state


componentDidMount() :

calls right before anything is displayed on the page.
